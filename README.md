# Basketball-team-C++
Nice code that me and my friend programed for collage while learning some rules about Inheritances, virtual and operators.

We had some instructions to follow in how the exercise structure will look like and what members and methods every class is needed.
Some of the methods we added by our won for the code to run nicer.

I like this code so much because its Neat, elegant, clean and clear.

We used Visual studio 2019, compiled by g++.

Have a fun coding!
